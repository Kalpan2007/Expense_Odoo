### Data Flow
1. User authenticates → Company and user created/loaded
2. Currency rates fetched → Stored in context
3. Expenses submitted → Auto-converted to company currency
4. Approval workflows created → Based on rules and hierarchy
5. Managers approve/reject → Status updates propagate
6. Analytics update → Real-time dashboard refresh

## API Integrations

- Auto-populates currency based on country selection
- Used during signup process

### Exchange Rate API

- Supports all major currencies
- Base currency configurable per company

## Security Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Context-isolated data access
- Secure state management
- Input validation
- Error boundaries

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Memoized currency conversions
- Cached exchange rates
- Efficient state updates
- Minimal re-renders

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Modern ES6+ features

## Next Steps for Production
1. Replace localStorage with Supabase backend
2. Add file upload for receipt images
3. Implement real OCR service integration
4. Add email notifications for approvals
5. Export reports (PDF/CSV)
6. Audit logs and compliance features
7. Mobile app version
8. Integration with accounting software
